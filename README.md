# GuestPoast
Do you run a static website? Are you tired of using off-site services to build a guestbook for your visitors to sign, only to have to have ads, or intrusive elements that shouldn't be on your site, or even _worse_ ... styling that you can't edit? Well, do I have ... somewhat of a solution for you.

Preface: I've accomplished this by utilizing a domain attached to a VPS with HTTPS enabled. It won't work without HTTPS. Don't even try. Now, in my last piece of web development code, I was made aware that Github can actually be used as a personal VPS for free, with limitations on used seconds per month. I'm _assuming_ that you could maybe do that with this. I'm using my VPS, because it's where all of my active projects are running, and I pay for it.

With that aside, let's get started.
